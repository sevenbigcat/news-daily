# Coronavirus outbreak in China sparks ‘super-spreader’ fears as pneumonia-like illness sickens hundreds

Health officials in China grappling to manage the outbreak of a new coronavirus now fear the disease could be a so-called “super-spreader.”

Officials this week also confirmed that the new coronavirus, which is linked to a seafood and animal market in Wuhan, is transmissible between humans.
