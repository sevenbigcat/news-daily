BEIJING (Reuters) - China's food supplies remain stable and consumers should not be "overly anxious" or even resort to "panic buying", a senior agriculture ministry official said on Wednesday, following recent uncertainty caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

Still, farmers and traders should prevent food waste caused by improper storage, while farmers who stockpile in the hope of later gains should be wary that prices could turn against them, ministry official Tang Ke told a briefing.
